## About Me ##

My career spans both industry and academia, involving Medical Imaging, Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering.  I'm interested in Computing, Statistics, Machine Learning, Cryptography, and Digital Security.  My LinkedIn profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ned-charles-7b54832).  I was one of those young kids that took everything apart, I managed to fix my [Walkman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman#Cassette-based) a few times as well as assemble a [HeathKit](http://heathkit.com) or two.  As a teenager I thought a cool job would be a test engineer at [Underwriter's Laboratories](https://www.ul.com/) and always had an affinity for engineering.

### Industry Experience ###
After getting my [Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering](https://purdue.edu/), I worked as a hardware engineer for a few years and then ended up switching to software development.  I spent ten years as a software developer in various industries spanning aerospace, billing, imaging, and finance.  I then decided to do graduate study full-time at the [University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au) for several years.  You can find out more about my academic research [here](/research/).  I am now working for [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com), makers of MATLAB and Simulink, which I am really enjoying. 

### Software and Computing ###

The bulk of my experience has been in C++ and C#, developing across the full stack using object-oriented programming.  I also have a lot of experience developing back-end interfaces using SQL and relational databases.  Prior to that I spent a few years working with C, including some embedded development work.  More recently, I have worked with [Python](https://www.python.org/), and did the bulk of my PhD using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).  I have also used [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and did some programming recently in Java to add features to [Camino](http://camino.cs.ucl.ac.uk/).

### Other Interests ###

I've spent many an hour listening to ambient music, played a lot of rugby union when I was younger, and I'm also a licensed pilot who likes to get up every now and then for some "aerial therapy".
